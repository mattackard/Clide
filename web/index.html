            <p>Clide is a tool for creating automated demos for terminal-based applications. 
                Using a json file, you can script out a demo in the terminal to free your hands up from having to copy and paste commands, 
                or handle typos when you're in the middle of giving a presentation.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>This page contains download links for .deb and .rpm packages for installation on debain and rpm based 
                linux distributions. To install clide, click the download for your operating system and install the 
                package using your operating systems default software manager. Alternatively you can clone the repository or 
                download the source code and use the makefile command <span>make install</span> to install clide from the 
                source code. See the project's github page and readme for more information regarding setting up 
                dependencies for development and to build the application from the source.</p></br>
            <img id="installImg" src="clide-demos.png" alt="how to run clide demos in terminal">
            <p>The demos included with the binary are <span>demo</span>, <span>windows</span>, and <span>network</span>. 
                These json files can be found in the <span>/usr/share/clide/examples</span> folder for reference. 
                Looking at the included demo json files is a good starting point to see all the options available when creating a demo with clide. 
                Note that some included demos may use linux packages not installed on your system. 
                If you see an error about a command not running because a program is not installed, you must install the package for the demo to execute properly.</p></br>
            <p>Follow the docs link at the top of the page to get information about what each of the possible json fields will do for your demo.</p>

            <h2>What can clide do?</h2>
            <p>Clide is built to seamlessly manage complete cli demo. To achieve this, clide has features that 
                allow for clearing the window, running multiple windows, running commands hidden from the window, and many more.
                Clide also comes packaged with a graphical editor that makes it easy to create a new clide demo using all the 
                available features, as well as converting a script file into a runnable clide demo directly.</p></br>
            <img id="editorImg" src="clide-editor.png" alt="editor modular window">
            <p>A more extensive list of features clide supports are below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-window demos</li>
                <li>Simulated command typing</li>
                <li>Time-based and keyboard triggered command execution</li>
                <li>Asynchronous commands</li>
                <li>Hidden commands</li>
                <li>Window clear before command execution</li>
                <li>Timeouts for commands that need to be interrupted</li>
                <li>Font customization</li>
                <li>Color customization</li>
                <li>Graphical demo editor</li>
            </ul>
