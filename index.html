            <p>Clide is a tool for creating automated demos for terminal-based applications. 
                Using a json file, you can script out a demo in the terminal to free your hands up from having to copy and paste commands, 
                or handle typos when you're in the middle of giving a presentation.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>Clide is currently only supporting debian-based linux distributions, but clide is still in active development!
                Future development will result in releases supported different linux package managers and maybe even Windows and MacOS.
                Once clide is installed, run it from the terminal using the clide command.</p></br>
            <img id="installImg" src="clide-demos.png" alt="how to run clide demos in terminal">
            <p>The demos included with the binary are <span>demo</span>, <span>windows</span>, and <span>network</span>. 
                These json files can be found in the <span>/usr/share/clide/examples</span> folder for reference. 
                Looking at the included demo json files is a good starting point to see all the options available when creating a demo with clide. 
                Note that some included demos may use linux packages not installed on your system. 
                If you see an error about a command not running because a program is not installed, you must install the package for the demo to execute properly.</p></br>
            <p>Follow the docs link at the top of the page to get information about what each of the possible json fields will do for your demo.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>To get started developing with clide, follow the github link at the top right of the page. 
                From there you can clone or fork the project and customize as you please.</p></br>
            <p>The docs link at the top of the page includes information about the clide package and structs within it.</p>
